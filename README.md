# Description

An open source automated video creation tool for generating short-form video content. Short Video Maker combines text-to-speech, automatic captions, background videos, and music to create engaging short videos from simple text inputs.

This project is meant to provide a free alternative to heavy GPU-power hungry video generation (and a free alternative to expensive, third-party API calls). It doesn't generate a video from scratch based on an image or an image prompt.

The server exposes an [MCP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) and a REST server.

While the MCP server can be used with an AI Agent (like n8n) the REST endpoints provide more flexibility for video generation.

# Features

- Generate complete short videos from text prompts
- Text-to-speech conversion
- Automatic caption generation and styling
- Background video search and selection via Pexels
- Background music with genre/mood selection
- Serve as both REST API and Model Context Protocol (MCP) server

# How It Works

Shorts Creator takes simple text inputs and search terms, then:

1. Converts text to speech using Kokoro TTS
2. Generates accurate captions via Whisper
3. Finds relevant background videos from Pexels
4. Composes all elements with Remotion
5. Renders a professional-looking short video with perfectly timed captions

# Limitations

- The project only capable generating videos with English voiceover (kokoro-js doesn‚Äôt support other languages at the moment)
- The background videos are sourced from Pexels

# General Requirements

- internet
- free pexels api key
- ‚â• 3 gb free RAM, my recommendation is 4gb RAM
- ‚â• 2 vCPU
- ‚â• 5gb disc space


## Scene

Each video is assembled from multiple scenes. These scenes consists of

1. Text: Narration, the text the TTS will read and create captions from.
2. Search terms: The keywords the server should use to find videos from Pexels API. If none can be found, joker terms are being used (`nature`, `globe`, `space`, `ocean`)
